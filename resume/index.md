# (short) Resume

---
<br/>

My name is Sam Atkinson. I am a Pennsylvania native and currently a student 
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York studying computer 
systems engineering. 

I am an undergraduate researcher in the Electrical, Computer, and Systems
Engineering Department at RPI developing internet-of-things sofware for 
Linux systems. I enjoy writing code and working on DIY projects in my 
free time, learning as much as possible along the way. 

A few of my programming projects can be found on my 
[github](https://github.com/atkinsam).
